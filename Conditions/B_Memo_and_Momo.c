// Memo and Momo are playing a game. Memo will choose a positive number a
// , and Momo will choose a positive number b. Your task is to tell them who will win according to the following rules:
// If both a and b are divisible by k, both of them win and you should print "Both".
// If a is divisible by k but b isn't, Memo wins and you should print "Memo".
// If b is divisible by k but a isn't, Momo wins and you should print "Momo".
// If both a and b are not divisible by k, no one wins and you should print "No One".
