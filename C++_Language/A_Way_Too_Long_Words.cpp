// Sometimes some words like "localization" or "internationalization" are so long that writing them many times in one text is quite tiresome.
// Let's consider a word too long, if its length is strictly more than 10 characters. All too long words should be replaced with a special abbreviation.
// This abbreviation is made like this: we write down the first and the last letter of a word and between them we write the number of letters between the first and
// the last letters. That number is in decimal system and doesn't contain any leading zeroes.
// Thus, "localization" will be spelt as "l10n", and "internationalizationÂ» will be spelt as "i18n".
// You are suggested to automatize the process of changing the words with abbreviations. At that all too long words should be replaced by 
//the abbreviation and the words that are not too long should not undergo any changes.
